Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "Output1"   (component BitIO)
   - Output1_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Output1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Output1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Output1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Output1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Output2"   (component BitIO)
   - Output2_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Output2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Output2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Output2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Output2_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Output3"   (component BitIO)
   - Output3_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Output3_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Output3_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Output3_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Output3_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Input"     (component BitIO)
   - Input_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "RNG1"      (component RNG_LDD)
   - RNG1_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device data 
                structure.   This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the Deinit method must be 
                called first.
   - RNG1_Deinit -Disables the device and frees the device data structure memory.
   - RNG1_SetEventMask -This method masks the events of the interrupts generated by errors or interrupts generated upon 
                completion of seed and self test modes in the RNGB.
   - RNG1_GetEventMask -This Methods returns the status of the interrupt error masks and interrupt completion masks.
   - RNG1_GetStatus -This method returns the value of the RNG status register. Use this method to poll status of RNG when 
                interrupts are disabled.
   - RNG1_InsertEntropy -Use this method to insert additional entropy to RNGA (current time using highest precision possible, 
                mouse and keyboard motions...).
   - RNG1_Main -This method is available only in polling mode. If interrupt service is disabled this method replaces the RNG 
                interrupt handler.
   - RNG1_GetRandomNumber -This method gets the next random number generated by the RNG.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512DC12)
